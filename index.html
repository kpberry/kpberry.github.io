                    <h1> About Me </h1>
                    <p>
                        My name is Kevin Berry, and I'm a sophomore Computer Science
                        student at Georgia Tech.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am fascinated by the inner workings of programming
                        languages and algorithms, and I love thinking of the best
                        ways to make my programs both efficient and robust. I am
                        proficient in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Java, Python, SQL,
                        Processing, and Regex, and I am working on learning Haskell
                        and Lisp to broaden my programming vocabulary. I am
                        currently developing both a project management system and a
                        graphing calculator in JavaScript, and I have worked on
                        projects like matrix manipulators, physics simulations, and
                        mathematical challenges in the past.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of my personal coding, I am a member of The Agency
                        at Georgia Tech, where I will soon begin working on the
                        programming of our college's own self driving car. I am also
                        a member of the Big O Theory club, where I attend problem
                        solving sessions and lectures on theoretical computer
                        science. I currently work as the Database Coordinator at the
                        Institute for Advanced Medical Research in Alpharetta,
                        Georgia, where I develop and organize software
                        customizations and extensions to help the clinical research
                        team capture, understand, and use data more effectively to
                        help both patients and clinical staff on a daily basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within the next year, I hope to begin developing and
                        understanding artificially intelligent algorithms so that I
                        can use them in my current projects, in the programming at
                        my job, and in future projects that I'll create or be a part
                        of. I want to be able to work on programs that help to make
                        the lives of others better, and I want to learn as much as I
                        can about computer science to know that I'm helping to the
                        fullest extent that I can.

	                    <li>Includes, as an example, the "Love" Force, which increases in magnitude as the square of the displacement between two particles and is, ostensibly, the strongest force of all</li>
	                    <li>Colors and sizes particles by the force fields they emit and can display the magnitudes of force interactions among all particles</li>
	                    <li>Capable of high-precision calculations due to a method that reduces the size and increases the frequency of computations</li>
	                    <li>Simulations obey conservation of energy, mass, and momentum (when there are no external forces)</li>
	                    <li>Previous version focused on collision detection and could use binary search on ordered pixels to efficiently detect collisions among many arbitrarily shaped objects</li>
