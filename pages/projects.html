                <ul>
                    <li>Efficiently calculates forces and interactions at arbitrary distances</li>
                    <li>Forces can be set up easily based on arbitrary rules by following a Force template</li>
                    <li>Includes variable Gravitational, Electrostatic, Spring, Resistive Fluid Forces</li>
                    <li>Includes, as an example, the "Love" Force, which increases in magnitude as the square of the displacement between two particles and is, ostensibly, the strongest force of all</li>
                    <li>Colors and sizes particles by the force fields they emit and can display the magnitudes of force interactions among all particles</li>
                    <li>Capable of high-precision calculations due to a method that reduces the size and increases the frequency of computations</li>
                    <li>Simulations obey conservation of energy, mass, and momentum (when there are no external forces)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Evaluates symbolic expressions of arbitrary parameter lengths</li>
                    <li>Based on regular expressions and basic arithmetic operators</li>
                    <li>Handles Vector and Complex values and their operations</li>
                    <li>Evaluates convergent summations, standard and hyperbolic trig functions, and derivatives</li>
                    <li>Can manipulate algebraic functions and perform term simplification and combination</li>
                    <li>Graphs functions, equations, and parametric equations and provides solutions at points</li>

                    <li>Uses the grayscale of the original image and a threshold intensity to determine the "plaidness" of a pixel in the final image to ensure the maintenance of edges and clearly defined shapes</li>
                    <li>Just written for fun, but with good results</li>
